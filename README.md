### **Minimum Expected Features**

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement secure user registration and login using email and password, along with the option for social media login (Facebook, Google). This ensures that only authenticated users can access the app’s functionalities and allows personalization.

2. **Profile Creation**:
   - Enable users to create and customize their profiles. The profile should include basic information such as the user’s name, location, preferred workouts (e.g., yoga, running, weightlifting), and fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, strength training).
   - **Example**: A user setting a goal of running 5 miles a week and specifying their workout preferences can help in matching with relevant buddies.

3. **Buddy Matching**:
   - Implement a basic algorithm to match users based on their fitness goals and preferred workouts. The location can also be factored in to suggest buddies who are geographically closer.
   - **Example**: A user interested in weightlifting in the same city is matched with another weightlifting enthusiast who shares a similar fitness goal.

4. **In-App Messaging**:
   - Provide basic messaging functionality so that users can communicate with their fitness buddies once matched. Messages can include sharing workout tips, arranging meetups, or providing support.
   - **Example**: After being matched, users can discuss meeting at the gym or sharing progress.

5. **Workout Tracking**:
   - Allow users to log and track their workouts. They should be able to enter details such as workout type, duration, and progress toward set milestones. 
   - **Example**: A user tracking their weekly running distance or weightlifting progress, and comparing it to their fitness goals.

6. **Weekly Progress Reports**:
   - Generate weekly summaries of user activities, highlighting completed workouts, calories burned, and progress toward fitness goals.
   - **Example**: At the end of the week, users receive a report showing they completed 4 out of 5 workouts and burned 1200 calories.

7. **Goal Setting and Notifications**:
   - Allow users to set specific fitness goals (e.g., "Run 10 miles a week") and send reminders to keep them accountable.
   - **Example**: If a user has not logged a workout by Wednesday, send a notification reminding them of their goal.

8. **Virtual Fitness Library**:
   - Provide a collection of workout videos or articles that users can access to enhance their fitness knowledge and routines.
   - **Example**: Users can watch a video on proper weightlifting form or find articles on nutrition.

### **Unique Features**

1. **Goal-Based Challenges and Rewards**:
   - Create goal-based challenges where users can invite buddies or join community challenges (e.g., "Run 50 miles in a month"). Provide virtual badges or rewards for completing these challenges, encouraging users to stay active.
   - **Example**: Users can compete in a 30-day fitness challenge, and upon completion, they are awarded a digital badge or points that unlock rewards like workout plans or discounts.

2. **Progress Sharing with Fitness Buddies**:
   - Allow users to share their workout logs and fitness progress directly with their buddies. This creates a collaborative and supportive atmosphere by enabling users to keep each other accountable and motivated.
   - **Example**: A user shares their weekly progress of losing 2 pounds, motivating their buddy to stay on track with their own fitness goal.

3. **Find Local Gyms and Fitness Classes**:
   - Integrate a feature that helps users find nearby gyms, fitness classes, or outdoor workout locations. Based on their profile and location, users can get recommendations for workout venues, making it easier to coordinate meetups with buddies.
   - **Example**: Users in a certain area can receive recommendations for nearby group yoga classes or running trails based on their workout preferences.

### **Challenging Features**

1. **Advanced Buddy Matching Algorithm (Based on Activity and Goals)**:
   - Build a more advanced matching algorithm that considers not only workout preferences and location but also users' actual activity levels (based on workout logs) and goals. The algorithm should learn from user behavior to improve buddy matches over time.
   - **Example**: If a user consistently logs strength training workouts but has not matched with anyone yet, the algorithm will prioritize finding strength-focused buddies within their location.

2. **Group Fitness and Live Leaderboard**:
   - Allow users to form workout groups and track group progress with a live leaderboard. Group members can log their workouts and see their collective progress in real-time, fostering friendly competition and support.
   - **Example**: A group of friends can join a challenge to collectively run 100 miles in a month, with each person's contribution being visible on the leaderboard. This feature can track and display the group's total distance, encouraging collaboration.

3. **Dashboard for Progress and Buddy Interaction Analytics**:
   - Implement a dashboard where users can view a detailed summary of their fitness journey, including workout statistics, progress toward goals, and insights into buddy interactions (e.g., how often they message buddies, how many workouts they've completed together).
   - **Example**: Users can view charts or graphs that show their workout frequency over the past month, or how their buddy has influenced their activity levels by motivating them to work out more consistently.
